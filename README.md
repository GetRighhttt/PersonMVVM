# PersonMVVM
<p>Using Jsonplaceholder to mimic an API call returning a list of users.<br>
 Spalsh with animation, listview, error handling, network request, progressview,<br>
 Dark and Light mode adjustments, and also MVVM architecture. More practice to<br>
 master ios. Displays an alert when there is no internet connection.<br>
I also added in a navigatin link to a detail page. When clicking the user name,<br>
the bottom sheet pops up with some more user info.</p>
